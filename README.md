### Running guidelines

A console application to display the steps needed, and shortest way,
to measure a specific amount of liquid with two different sized bottles.

Open in Visual Studio, hit F5 and enter a number bigger than 0,
the program will print out the steps for two different methods to get to the
required amount of liquid and say how many steps you need for the shortest,
if there is a possible solution.
Unit tests included.
